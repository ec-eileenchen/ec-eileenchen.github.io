                    <h2>From Personal Experience to Hands-On Practice - A Deep Dive into Fraud Detection</h2>
                    <p>My capstone journey, "Understanding How Credit Card Fraud is Detected and Protecting Yourself From Fraud", was born at the intersection of personal experience and professional aspiration. 
                        During an intervire for an investment banking internship, I was asked about fraud detection models related cases. It made me realize that these cases questions weren't just theoretical, it was a windo into the real-world challenges that financial institutions encounter with daily.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The topic became personally complelling because it demystified a common experience, receiving a text from the bank asking whether it was you that was using the card, and transformed it into a tangible data science problem. 
                        I saw this proect as the perfect opportunity to bride my academicd stydies in Applied Computing, Data Analytics, and Business Administration with my career ambitions in the dunamix fintech space.</p>
                    <h2>From Data to Insights</h2>
                    <p>I work with the massive Vesta partnered IEEE-CIS dataset consists 435 features from merged transaction and identity information tables. 
                        A major data quality issue was the presence of missing values and features on vastly different scales. My data analytics minor provided the framework for a proper preprocessing stage, which imvolved imputation for missing values, one-hot encoding for categorical veriables, and robust standardization to ensure no feature is set up correctly for the models.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The model selection process was a lesson in empirical testing and theoretical understanding. I experimented with XGBoost, LightGBM, and the LSTM network. The LSTM's underperformance was a key learning moment. My hypothesis, due to the characteristic of the dataset, was that the sequential nature of LSTMs required longer, consistent frudulent patterns to learn from.
                        Given the extreme small amout of fraud cases in the dataset, the LSTM struggled to find meaningful temporal dependencies,
                        where tree-based models like LightGBM outperform at evaluating the complex relationships between hundred of features at a single point in time. 
                        Light GBM was ultimately selected nor only for its performance across key metrics but also for its computational efficiency, which was critical given the dataset's size and my hardware constraints.
                        Learning to implement and tune these models, especially the entirely new concept of LSTMs, was a steep curve. I relied heavily on official documentation and other related blog posts, where the key insight was understandinghow to structure time-series data for LSTM input and the importance of its hyperparameters.</p>
