                    <h2>From Personal Experience to Hands-On Practice</h2>
                    <p>My capstone journey, "Understanding How Credit Card Fraud is Detected and Protecting Yourself From Fraud", was born at the intersection of personal experience and professional aspiration. 
                        During an intervire for an investment banking internship, I was asked about fraud detection models related cases. It made me realize that these cases questions weren't just theoretical, it was a windo into the real-world challenges that financial institutions encounter with daily.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The topic became personally complelling because it demystified a common experience, receiving a text from the bank asking whether it was you that was using the card, and transformed it into a tangible data science problem. 
                        I saw this proect as the perfect opportunity to bride my academicd stydies in Applied Computing, Data Analytics, and Business Administration with my career ambitions in the dunamix fintech space.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <h2>From Data to Insights</h2>
                    <p>I work with the massive Vesta partnered IEEE-CIS dataset consists 435 features from merged transaction and identity information tables. 
                        A major data quality issue was the presence of missing values and features on vastly different scales. My data analytics minor provided the framework for a proper preprocessing stage, which imvolved imputation for missing values, one-hot encoding for categorical veriables, and robust standardization to ensure no feature is set up correctly for the models.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The model selection process was a lesson in empirical testing and theoretical understanding. I experimented with XGBoost, LightGBM, and the LSTM network. The LSTM's underperformance was a key learning moment. My hypothesis, due to the characteristic of the dataset, was that the sequential nature of LSTMs required longer, consistent frudulent patterns to learn from.
                        Given the extreme small amout of fraud cases in the dataset, the LSTM struggled to find meaningful temporal dependencies,
                        where tree-based models like LightGBM outperform at evaluating the complex relationships between hundred of features at a single point in time. 
                        Light GBM was ultimately selected nor only for its performance across key metrics but also for its computational efficiency, which was critical given the dataset's size and my hardware constraints.
                        Learning to implement and tune these models, especially the entirely new concept of LSTMs, was a steep curve. I relied heavily on official documentation and other related blog posts, where the key insight was understandinghow to structure time-series data for LSTM input and the importance of its hyperparameters.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <h2>Navigating Challenges and Refining the Vision</h2>
                    <p>A significant challenge was adjusting and improving model performance with real-world utility. While the accuracy was high, the null accuracy was also high, which is common phenomenon in imbalanced datasets where fraud is rare.
                        The breakthrough cam from applying a business-minded perspective. I shifted my focus from raw accuracy to the precision-recall trade-off. In fraud detection, missing a fraudulent transaction, low recall, creates bigger consequences than occasionally flagging a legitimate transaction, lower precision.
                        This strategic pivot showcase that I was evaluating my model not on an abstract academic metric, but on a framework that reflected actual business costs and risks.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This project was also a lesson in scope management and stakeholder engagement. Early meeting with the Financial Empowerement Network (FEN) was a right move. their feedback on emphasizing mobile accesibility, multi-language support, basic credit card user rights, and a focus on mitigating the consequences of fraud rather than just prevention directly shaped the final webpage's design.
                        Similarly, my faculty expert's advice to drop the chatbot feature was valuable but difficult for me to let go of. However, this strategic de-scoping allowed me to re-asslocate my time and energy toward refining the core machinelearning model and the explanatory SHAP analysis, significantly strengthening the project's foundation.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <h2>Key Takeaways and Professional Growth</h2>
                    <p>The moment of greatest validation cam when the SHAP analysis yielded consistent result across different models. The consistency was critical because the SHAP output was the centerpiece of my webpage, the explainable AI part of the model building that would educate users on what factors triggers fraud alerts.
                        If the results had been widely different for each model, it would have undermined the credibility of the entire explanatory framework.
                        The consistency felt like a confirmation that my entire methodological process, from data cleaning to model training, had converged on a stable, meaningful truth about the data.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                        <p>Looking back, my initial assumption that accuracy was the primary success metric was my most significant miscalculation, and correctingit was a profound learning experience. 
                            If I had more time, I would explore an ensemble approach, perhaps unsing a high-presision model to verify the alerts from a high-recall model, to push the performance boundaries further.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This capstone has fundamentally shaped my professional outlook. It demonstrated that being a data scientist infintech is not just about building the most complex model, but about building the right model for the business context, understanding the stakeholder;s needs, and communicating complex results with clarity.
                        This project had given me a concrete story to tell in intervierws, shocasing not just my technical skills in machine learning, but also my stategic thinking and ability to learn and adapt under pressure.
                        It had solidify my confidence to pursue a career where I can leverage data to solve meaningful, real-world problems.
